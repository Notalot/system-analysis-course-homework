# Homeworks for System Analysis course
I have taken a [course of System Analysis](https://education.borshev.com/system-analysis). This repository is for homeworks and better understanding the progress. 

During the course I am creating a system description (requirements for the system are in the course). Initial version is how I understand the description should be done from before course point of view. With every new lesson I upgrade the system according received knowledge so that in the end in the `main` branch it will be, let's say, the ideal description as I've managed to learn it from the course. 

I assume that for each lesson task I create a branch with lesson name and number, complete the task there, create PR to `main` branch to see the difference and then merge it.
